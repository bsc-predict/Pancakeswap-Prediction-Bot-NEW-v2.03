## Strategy

The strategy can be found in [src/lib.ts](https://github.com/AssaEmpireToken/Pancakeswap-Prediction-Bot-NEW-v2.03/blob/main/src/lib.ts#L38). The base strategy looks at the bull and bear total bet amounts at the time the bet is made.

It bets bear if (bull > bear and bull / bear < 5) OR (bull < bear and bear / bull > 5) otherwise bet bull.

Experimental option just flips the bets.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of clones!!

Beware of forks. I do not give any guarantee that the fork may turn out to be a scam. I'm coding this stuff on a pure open source. I do my best to publish       constant updates and bug fixes. the bot has a very small tax in the claim function, so we both win. At the same time you support me, this project and the following projects. 

Love you all and thank you to use my Script ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
